## Sing Up Panel  
You can send your information to database to sign up the system, hint: filling all the gaps is an obligation.
## Login Panel  
If you before registered the system, you can login the panel. There's two type of user: Student and Educator. After login process you'll see different panel 
as to your user level which at the same time have different specifications.  
## Educator Panel  
First of all it should be known that all users have its unique panel, I mean if one user make some changes it wouldn't affect others.  
There's three tab at the top of the educator panel :
- Trainings : It's a unique training panel to this educator, this educator can only see the trainings which he teach  
- Contents : Here's some features:   
  - With the side panel, educator can add and update contents to it's lessons with a header and a link. Also via this panel deleting process can be made.
  - At the top panel, user can search the contents by content's title and it's lesson. Hint: If both gap is filled simultaneously, system also have the search 
   ability at this situation.
- Quiz : All quizzes have to be a part of a content. So this situation also require some features like what if a content is deleted?
So a binding process is mandatory, that's why if a content is deleted it's quizzes also deleted at the same time, but the opposite doesn't occurs,
so if you delete a quiz it wouldn't affect any content. Also quizzes are added and deleted with the help of side panel.
## Student Panel  
There's also three tab at the top of the student panel :
- Courses : You can attend any of lesson on that panel. If you want to see and use any content of any lesson, firstly you have to attend that lesson, after that you can 
see all of it's content on the next tab which is caleld my studies.
